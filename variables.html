  <h1> Global Variables </h1>

  <p>
    Global variables have permanent values throughout the LISP system and remain in effect until a new value is specified.
    <br/>
    Global variables are generally declared using the <b>defvar</b> construct.
</p>

<details>
  <summary>For example</summary>
  <pre>
    (defvar x 24)
    (print x)
  </pre>
</details>

<details>
<summary>  <b> setq : </b> The defvar special form is similar to setq in that it sets the value of a variable. It is unlike setq in two ways: first, it only sets the value of the variable if the variable does not already have a value. If the variable already has a value, defvar does not override the existing value.</summary>

  <pre>
    (setq x 10)
    (setq y 20)
    (format t "x = ~2d y = ~2d ~%" x y)

    (setq x 100)
    (setq y 200)
    (format t "x = ~2d y = ~2d" x y)
  </pre>
  <br/>
  <pre>
    x = 10 y = 20
    x = 100 y = 200
  </pre>

</details>

<h1>Local Variables</h1>

Local variables are defined within a given procedure. The parameters named as arguments within a function definition are also local variables.
<br/>Local variables are accessible only within the respective function.
<br/>
Like the global variables, local variables can also be created using the setq construct.
<br/>
There are two other constructs - <b>let</b> and <b>prog</b> for creating local variables.

<b>let</b>
<pre>
    (let ((x '10) (y 'b)(z 'c))
    (format t "x = ~a y = ~a z = ~a" x y z))
</pre>

<pre>
    x = 10 y = B z = C
</pre>

The prog construct also has the list of local variables as its first argument, which is followed by the body of the prog, and any number of s-expressions.
<br/>
The prog function executes the list of s-expressions in sequence and returns nil unless it encounters a function call named return. Then the argument of the return function is evaluated and returned.

<pre>
    (prog ((x '(a b c))(y '(1 2 3))(z '(p q 10)))
    (format t "x = ~a y = ~a z = ~a" x y z))
</pre>
